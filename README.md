# Pharmaceutical Study Analysis
For this activity, data from a pharmaceutical study was prepared and cleaned, then used in activities including:
- creating summary statistics tables to outline mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen;
- creating bar plots showing the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen;
- generating pie plots to show the distribution of female and male mice in the study;
- calculating the quartiles and IQR for Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, and determining outliers using the upper and lower bounds;
- generating a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens;
- creating a scatter plot of tumor volume versus mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment regimen; and
- calculating the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment.
